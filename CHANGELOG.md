## [1.4.1] - 2026-01-03

### Fixed

- **Disk benchmark cache leak**: Random read was hitting filesystem cache
  - Increased random file size to 1GB (full) / 512MB (quick) to exceed cache
  - Apply F_NOCACHE BEFORE writing test files (not just on read)
  - Results now stable and reproducible

### Changed

- **Disk baselines recalibrated** to real M1 values with strict cache bypass:
  - Seq Read: 2180 MB/s (was 3356 - NovaBench includes cache)
  - Seq Write: 700 MB/s (was 3279 - with F_FULLFSYNC)
  - Rand Read: 43 MB/s (was 166 - true random from 1GB file)
  - Rand Write: 17 MB/s (was 761 - with final sync)
- Our tool now measures **actual disk performance**, not cache throughput
- This makes scores more meaningful for real-world workloads

### Technical Details

- Random tests now use 1GB file (full) / 512MB (quick) to exceed unified memory cache
- F_NOCACHE applied to write operations to prevent cache population
- Disk scores should now be stable across runs (~1000 on M1)

## [1.4.0] - 2026-01-02

### Added

- **NovaBench-compatible disk benchmark patterns** for improved comparability
  - Sequential I/O: 4MB blocks with cache bypass
  - Random I/O: 4KB blocks, QD1 (single operation) pattern
  - Matches industry-standard benchmark methodology

### Changed

- **Disk benchmark output**: All tests now report MB/s consistently
  - Random tests converted from IOPS to MB/s (IOPS × 4KB / 1MB)
  - Enables direct comparison with NovaBench and other tools
- **Baseline values updated** to NovaBench M1 reference measurements:
  - Seq Read: 3356 MB/s, Seq Write: 3279 MB/s
  - Rand Read: 166 MB/s, Rand Write: 761 MB/s
- Increased quick mode file size to 256MB (was 128MB) for more stable results
- Sequential tests now sync file before reading (F_FULLFSYNC)

### Technical Details

- Sequential: 4MB blocks, cache bypass via `F_NOCACHE`, sync via `F_FULLFSYNC`
- Random: 4KB blocks, QD1 pattern (one I/O at a time), cache bypass

## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

  - CPU Multi-Core: Added dedicated multi-core baselines (not scaled from single)
  - Memory: Read, Write, Copy, Latency
  - Disk: Sequential Read/Write, Random Read/Write IOPS
  - GPU: Compute, Particles, Blur, Edge detection
- M1 base chip now correctly scores ~1000 in each category
- Other Apple Silicon chips score proportionally (M2 ~1100, M3 ~1290, M4 ~1600)

### Added

- **Ratio clamping for Disk scores**: Clamp ratios to 0.25-4.0 range
  - Prevents cache effects from producing unrealistic scores
  - Handles SSD capacity variance (256GB vs 1TB have different speeds)
  - More stable scores across different volume states

### Fixed

- CPU Multi-Core scoring: Now uses dedicated multi-core baselines instead of
  incorrectly scaling single-core values by core count

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-01

### Changed
