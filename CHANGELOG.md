## [1.3.2] - 2026-01-02

### Changed

- **Baseline calibration**: Re-calibrated all reference values from median of 5 real M1 runs
  - CPU Single-Core: Integer, Float, SIMD, Crypto, Compression
  - CPU Multi-Core: Added dedicated multi-core baselines (not scaled from single)
  - Memory: Read, Write, Copy, Latency
  - Disk: Sequential Read/Write, Random Read/Write IOPS
  - GPU: Compute, Particles, Blur, Edge detection
- M1 base chip now correctly scores ~1000 in each category
- Other Apple Silicon chips score proportionally (M2 ~1100, M3 ~1290, M4 ~1600)

### Added

- **Ratio clamping for Disk scores**: Clamp ratios to 0.25-4.0 range
  - Prevents cache effects from producing unrealistic scores
  - Handles SSD capacity variance (256GB vs 1TB have different speeds)
  - More stable scores across different volume states

### Fixed

- CPU Multi-Core scoring: Now uses dedicated multi-core baselines instead of
  incorrectly scaling single-core values by core count

## [1.3.1] - 2026-01-01

### Changed

- **Scoring algorithm**: Switched from arithmetic mean to geometric mean of ratios
  - Prevents outliers from dominating category scores

- Re-calibrated baseline reference values from real M1 measurements

### Added

## [1.2.4] - 2026-01-01

### Security

- Hardened file permissions in disk benchmarks (0o600 instead of 0o644)

- Secure file permissions (0o700/0o600) for machine ID storage (CWE-312)

## [1.2.3] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- Total score normalization now uses benchmark presence (not score > 0)
- Failed benchmarks show "Failed" instead of being hidden
- Multi-core scoring scales with actual core count (not hardcoded 8)
- HTML report hides categories that weren't run (partial runs)
- Chart only shows benchmarks that were actually run

## [1.2.2] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- Scoring system: CPU reference units now match benchmark output (Mops/s, GFLOPS, MB/s)
- Partial runs (`--only`) now calculate total score using only selected benchmarks
- Failed tests (value = 0) are excluded from score averages

### Added

- Quick mode warning in score output ("scores may be less accurate")
- Partial run info in score output ("total based on selected tests")

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-31

### Changed

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed
