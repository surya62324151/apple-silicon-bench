# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [1.2.3] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- Total score normalization now uses benchmark presence (not score > 0)
- Failed benchmarks show "Failed" instead of being hidden
- Multi-core scoring scales with actual core count (not hardcoded 8)
- HTML report hides categories that weren't run (partial runs)
- Chart only shows benchmarks that were actually run

## [1.2.2] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- Scoring system: CPU reference units now match benchmark output (Mops/s, GFLOPS, MB/s)
- Partial runs (`--only`) now calculate total score using only selected benchmarks
- Failed tests (value = 0) are excluded from score averages

### Added

- Quick mode warning in score output ("scores may be less accurate")
- Partial run info in score output ("total based on selected tests")

## [1.2.1] - 2025-12-31

### Changed

- CLI output style: replaced box-drawing pipes with clean lines and dot-padding
- Improved terminal compatibility across different fonts and encodings

## [1.2.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- Disk information in `osx-bench info` command (model, capacity, type SSD/HDD)
- Disk info included in JSON exports and HTML reports

## [1.1.3] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- Chart.js loading in HTML report (removed SRI due to CDN hash instability)
- CLI banner text alignment for dynamic version length

## [1.1.2] - 2025-12-31

### Security

- Pin Chart.js to version 4.4.1 (supply-chain security)
- Remove machine ID from JSON exports (privacy protection)
- Use UUID-based temp directory for disk benchmarks (prevent symlink attacks)
- Replace `try!` with `do/catch` in CryptoKit calls (prevent crash/DoS)

### Fixed

- GitHub Actions CI workflow permissions

## [1.1.1] - 2025-12-31

### Fixed

- Dynamic copyright year (was hardcoded to 2024)
- Developer credits wording ("Designed and developed by")

### Added

- Release date field in version output
- Versioning guidelines in CLAUDE.md

## [1.1.0] - 2025-12-31

### Added

- `--duration` option to control test duration per benchmark category
- `--stress` flag for extended 60-second tests
- Duration-based benchmark loops (replaces fixed iteration counts)
- Roadmap section in README.md with versioned milestones (v1.2-v1.6)
- `xattr -cr` quarantine removal instruction in README

### Changed

- Default test duration: 10 seconds per category
- Quick mode duration: 3 seconds per category

## [1.0.1] - 2024-12-31

### Fixed

- Ad-hoc code signing to reduce macOS Gatekeeper warnings
- Improved download instructions with `xattr -cr` for quarantine removal
- Centralized version management via Package.swift

### Added

- Version bump script (`scripts/bump-version.sh`)
- AppInfo enum for consistent version display across CLI and reports
