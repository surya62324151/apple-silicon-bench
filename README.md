### CPU Multi-Core

Same tests as single-core, executed in parallel across all CPU cores with efficiency scaling measurement.

### Memory

| Test | Description | Metric |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Read | Sequential memory read bandwidth | GB/s |
| Write | Sequential memory write bandwidth | GB/s |

### GPU (Metal)

Native Metal compute benchmarks for Apple Silicon integrated GPUs.

| Test | Description | Metric |
|------|-------------|--------|
| Compute | Matrix multiplication (2048x2048) | GFLOPS |
| Particles | Particle physics simulation (1M particles) | Mparts/s |
| Blur | Gaussian blur 5x5 kernel (4096x4096) | MP/s |
| Edge | Sobel edge detection (4096x4096) | MP/s |

**Technical details:**
- Metal shaders compiled at runtime (no external dependencies)
- Synthetic test images generated procedurally
- Quick mode uses reduced sizes (1024 matrix, 100K particles, 2048 images)

## Thermal Monitoring

The benchmark tracks macOS thermal state throughout the run:

- 🟢 **Nominal**: Normal operation, no throttling
- 🟡 **Fair**: Slightly warm, minor throttling possible
- 🟠 **Serious**: Hot, significant throttling active
- 🔴 **Critical**: Maximum throttling, severely impacted

If throttling is detected, results may be lower than optimal. Consider waiting for the system to cool down.

## HTML Report

After each benchmark run, a detailed HTML report is generated at:

```
~/Desktop/OSX-Bench-Reports/osx-bench-report-YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mm-ss.html
```

The report includes:
- System information (chip, cores, RAM, macOS version)
- Score breakdown with interactive charts
- Thermal progression timeline
- Detailed results for each benchmark category

View an [example HTML report](Sources/assets/osx-bench-report-2025-12-31_15-05-37.html) to see the output format.

## Scoring System

Scores are normalized against a baseline (M1 base chip = 1000 points per category):

- **CPU Single-Core**: 25% of total score
- **CPU Multi-Core**: 25% of total score
- **Memory**: 15% of total score
- **Disk**: 15% of total score
- **GPU**: 20% of total score

Higher scores indicate better performance. An M1 chip scores approximately 1000 in each category.

## Supported Systems

- **macOS**: 13.0 (Ventura) or later
- **Architecture**: Apple Silicon only (M1, M2, M3, M4, M5 family)
- **Processor Types**: MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, Mac mini, Mac Studio, Mac Pro, iMac

## Comparison Examples

Use this tool to compare different Apple Silicon configurations:

- M1 vs M1 Pro vs M1 Max vs M1 Ultra
- M2 vs M3 vs M4 vs M5
- Base vs Pro vs Max variants
- Different RAM configurations
- MacBook vs Mac Studio thermal performance

### Why Apple Silicon Bench?

1. **Transparency**: Know exactly what's being measured. Geekbench's "single-core score" is a black box.
2. **No Cloud Required**: Your benchmarks stay on your machine. No accounts, no uploads.
3. **Thermal Awareness**: See if your score dropped due to throttling, not slow hardware.
4. **Focused**: Built specifically for Apple Silicon, not ported from x86.
5. **Extensible**: Open source means you can add benchmarks relevant to your workflow.
6. **Lightweight**: A 2MB binary vs gigabytes of downloads.

### When to Use Other Tools

- **Geekbench**: When you need cross-platform comparisons (Mac vs PC vs Phone)
- **Cinebench**: When you specifically care about 3D rendering performance
- **Blackmagic**: When you need ProRes-specific disk speed validation for video workflows

## Design Decisions

### Why We Chose Native Frameworks Over External Dependencies

A core principle of Apple Silicon Bench is staying **lightweight** (~2-5MB binary) while providing comprehensive benchmarks. This means we prefer macOS built-in frameworks over external dependencies.

| Feature Request | Our Approach | Why Not the Alternative? |
|-----------------|--------------|--------------------------|
| **AI/ML Benchmark** | CoreML + BNNS | ❌ MLX requires Python/C++ runtime (~100MB+). BNNS is Apple's neural network primitives, built into macOS. |
| **Video Transcoding** | VideoToolbox | ❌ FFmpeg adds ~80MB binary. VideoToolbox accesses the same hardware encoders (ProRes, HEVC, H.264) natively. |
| **JavaScript Benchmark** | JavaScriptCore | ❌ V8/SpiderMonkey would add ~20MB+. JSC is Safari's engine, built into macOS. |
| **Compile Benchmark** | Swift only | ❌ Rust toolchain is ~500MB. Swift/Xcode is commonly installed on dev Macs. |

### What We Won't Add (and Why)

| Feature | Reason |
|---------|--------|
| **MLX Framework Tests** | Requires separate Python environment, not self-contained |
| **Rust/Go/C++ Compile Tests** | Would require users to install additional toolchains |
| **FFmpeg Transcoding** | 80MB dependency for something VideoToolbox does natively |
| **Chrome/V8 JavaScript** | Massive dependency; JavaScriptCore provides equivalent browser-style workload |
| **CUDA/OpenCL Tests** | Not relevant for Apple Silicon (Metal is the native GPU API) |

### Trade-offs We Accept

1. **CoreML Model Size**: We bundle a small MobileNet model (~500KB) for Neural Engine benchmarks. This slightly increases binary size but enables ANE testing without network downloads.

2. **Xcode Requirement for Compile Benchmark**: The Swift compile benchmark requires Xcode to be installed. We detect this at runtime and skip gracefully if unavailable.

3. **Power Monitoring Limitations**: Real power consumption requires IOKit entitlements that may not work on all Mac configurations. We provide best-effort monitoring with clear disclaimers.
